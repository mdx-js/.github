# Security policy

> **Note**: this policy is new and untested.
> We’ll update and polish it as we’re receiving security issues.

## Brand promise

Keeping users safe and secure is a top priority for us at
[**MDX**][mdx].
We welcome the contribution of external security researchers.

## Scope

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or
website governed by MDX, we encourage you to notify us.

Projects governed by MDX sometimes do unsafe things by design (such as a
plugin that executes arbitrary code or an option that is dangerous).
This unsafe behaviour should be explicitly documented and, if it is, is not
considered a security issue.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a
security issue or a “regular” issue.
When in doubt, please do send us a report.

## How to submit a report

To submit a security issue, please contact the members of the unified
[**core team**][core].
The team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours.
You will receive a more detailed response within 96 hours.

We will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally,
and when needed, invite you to the advisory.

## Safe harbour

**MDX** supports safe harbour for security researchers who:

*   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data,
    and interruption or degradation of our services
*   Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
    account holder.
    If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us
    immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local
    information
*   Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior
    to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
*   We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to
    constitute “authorised” conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate
    a complaint to law enforcement.
    We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third
    party against you

Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent
with or unaddressed by this policy.

## Preferences

*   Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly
    defined impact
*   Submit one vulnerability per report
*   Social engineering (such as phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited
