# Security policy

## Brand promise

Keeping users safe and secure is a top priority for us at
**[MDX][]**.
We welcome the contribution of external security researchers.

## Scope

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software,
service,
or website governed by MDX,
we encourage you to notify us.

Projects governed by MDX sometimes do unsafe things by design (such as a
plugin that executes arbitrary code or an option that is dangerous).
This unsafe behaviour should be explicitly documented and,
if it is,
is not considered a security issue.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a
security issue or a “regular” issue.
When in doubt,
please do send us a report.

## How to submit a report

Security issues can be reported by sending an email to `security@unifiedjs.com`,
which will go to all **[unified collective core team][core]** members.
The team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours.
You will receive a more detailed response within 96 hours.

We will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally,
and when needed,
invite you to the advisory.

## Safe harbor

**MDX** supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

* make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations,
  destruction of data,
  and interruption or degradation of our services
* only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
  account holder;
  if you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us
  immediately,
  do not proceed with access,
  and immediately purge any local information
* provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior
  to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
* we will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to
  constitute “authorised” conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate
  a complaint to law enforcement;
  we will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third
  party against you

Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent
with or unaddressed by this policy.

## Preferences

* please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly
  defined impact
* submit one vulnerability per report
* social engineering (such as phishing,
  vishing,
  smishing) is prohibited
